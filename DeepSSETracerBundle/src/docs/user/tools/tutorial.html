<h3><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2021.710119/full">DeepSSETracer</a> Instruction:</h3>
<p>
<b>DeepSSETracer</b> is a tool for detecting secondary structures using the best GEM-UNET model that had been trained
	from our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3388440.3414710">previous work</a> in Cryo-EM images. It is
	capable of detecting helices and beta sheets in images of medium resolution
</p>

<p>
<b>Required Input:</b><br><br>
	1. MRC: MRC map needs to be resampled to 1.0 Angstrom voxel size before running the tool, click the browse button to select
	the resampled MRC file.
	<br>
	2.Output directory: Click the browse button to select the Output path.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Resampling MRC:</b>
	<br><br>
	To resample an MRC file to 1.0 Angstrom, we can use ChimeraX command line:<br>
	1. "open mymap.mrc"<br>
	2. "volume resample #1 spacing 1.0"<br>
	3. "save mymap-1A.mrc model #2"<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Run:</b><br><br>
	After providing the necessary input, hit the run button to start the procedure, the log file will be displayed later.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Output:</b><br><br>
	Output will be the predicted helix.mrc and sheet.mrc. It will be directly displayed once the
	prediction finished. If the result is invisible, you may set a proper level in the panel in ChimeraX. It also can be
	 found in the output directory.
</p>


<p>
<b>Note:</b><br><br>
	1. The procedure takes a few seconds with GPU, and a few seconds to a few minutes without GPU. The time usage
	depends on the size of the image and the Computer or server. For a example, a image with size: 74*59*83 takes 81
	seconds without GPU, and 7 seconds with one GPU.<br>
	2. If the images is too big to run on your computer, you may try to box chopped to smaller images to run.<br>
